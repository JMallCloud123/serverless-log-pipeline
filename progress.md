I just officially completed my White Belt AWS Dojo Project:

âœ… Built a serverless, event-driven architecture using S3, Lambda, DynamoDB
âœ… Integrated API Gateway to allow external log ingestion
âœ… Secured it with IAM
âœ… Deployed, tested, debugged, and committed everything like a real Cloud Engineer
